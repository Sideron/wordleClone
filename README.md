<h1>Wordle clone project</h1>
<p>This is just a javascript project I've made to learn the basics of the language.</p>
<p>It consits basically on a minigame where you have to guees a random word by entering in an input box. The game will tell you wich letters are correct or belong to the original word.</p>
<p>Currently the database is in spanish ðŸ˜…, pls if you find another database with more words in english let me know!!</p>
<p>A preview of the app:</p>
